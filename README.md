### 3. Tabular Format Prompting
**Prompt:**  
> "Present system features, benefits, and stakeholders in a table."  

| Feature                       | Benefit                                      | Responsible Stakeholders |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Real-time sensor monitoring    | Early anomaly detection, reduced downtime   | Operators, Engineers    |
| Predictive maintenance alerts  | Plan maintenance, reduce costs              | Maintenance Team        |
| Energy optimization            | Reduced electricity usage                    | Operations Managers     |
| Cloud-based dashboards         | Remote monitoring, centralized control       | IT & Operations Team    |
| Role-based dashboards          | Personalized user experience                 | Managers & Engineers    |
| Mobile alerts & notifications | Faster issue resolution                       | Managers, Supervisors  |
