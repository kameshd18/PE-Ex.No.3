### 2. Persona and Context Prompts
**Prompt:**  
> "What should the user interface and control system convey to operators and managers?"  

**Generated Context & Example Interaction:**  
- **Intuitive Dashboard:** Graphical display of machine KPIs and alerts  
- **Role-based Views:** Operators see individual machine performance; managers see plant-level overview  
- **Trust & Reliability:** System clearly shows predictive alerts with confidence levels  

**Example Chatbot Response:**  
> **User:** "Why is Machine 3 showing a high vibration alert?"  
> **Chatbot:** "Machine 3's vibration sensor detected abnormal frequency exceeding safe thresholds. Predictive analysis suggests possible bearing wear. Recommended action: schedule maintenance within 24 hours."  

**UI/UX Metrics:**  
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Dashboard response time | < 2 seconds |
| Alert accuracy | > 95% correct predictions |
| User satisfaction | > 90% positive survey responses |
